# Statistical Machine Translation between MWT and MSW
 
This is machine translation between <b>Myanmar written text and Myanmar SignWriting</b> during Master Thesis Period.

We intended to fullfill communication between normal people and hearing impaired people.
<br/>Myanmar language is one of under-resource language and corpus are rare to build.
<br/>Therefore, We focused only on <b>Emergency Cases</b> including fire, earthquake, flood, health, strom, etc.

We build 888 parallel corpus with Myanmar, Sign Language and SignWriting.
